Description of Odin Recipes (First Assignment in Odin Project):
- This project is a simple Recipe Website. There is currently a functioning index page with 6 relative links to diffrent recipes. Each Recipe contains an image, a header, 1-2 sub-headers, an ordered list and an un-ordered list. There is a functioning anchor tag that takes the user back to the top of the page and another functiong anchor tag that takes the user back the main page.

Things I learned in this project:
- Headers and Sub-Headers "<h1>" "<h2>" "<h3>" etc
- Paragraphs "<p>"
- Anchor Tags (<a>) with Absolute (pages on other websites) and Relative links (other pages within our website)
- Images (<img>) and how to access the Directory ("./" and Parent Directory ("../")
- Proper File Structure (how the files for my website are structured)
- Learned how to create a anchor tag that takes user back to the top of the page "<a href="#top">Back to the Top</a>"
- Became more familliar with using the terminal to push my project to GitHub / also got experience using the Git GUI (<-- really like this!)
- Got some practice writing a propper commit message
