    milk, and butter.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Line an 8-inch square baking dish with foil or parchment paper. Leave a bit of an overhang to make removing the
      fudge easier later on. </li>
    <li>Add the sweetened condensed milk, butter, and chocolate chips to a saucepan. Stir often over medium heat until
      the mixture is fully melted and smooth. </li>
    <li>Remove the fudge mixture from the stove and stir in any chopped nuts or dried fruit you wish to use. </li>
    <li>Spread the melted fudge into an even layer in your prepared baking dish. Refrigerate it until fully set; this
      will take about 3 hours.</li>
