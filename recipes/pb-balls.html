  <h3>Peanut butter balls are always a good idea â€” and this top-rated recipe is all the proof you need.</h3>
  <p>The recipe for these peanut butter balls was shared by my 96-year-old neighbor, Mrs. Lucille Savage. She still
    makes them at Christmas and now I do too.</p>
  <p>Peanut butter balls are always a crowd-favorite with a hardened chocolate coating and a smooth, creamy,
    melt-in-your-mouth peanut butter filling. This recipe delivers an unexpected, but delightful crunch, thanks to the
    addition of crisp rice cereal.</p>
