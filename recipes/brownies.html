  <h3>I know that saying these are the “best brownies, ever” is a bold statement, but we truly believe it.</h3>
  <p>
    This is my absolute favorite brownie recipe. They are rich, fudgy in the middle, and made completely from scratch.
    These homemade brownies are so much better than the box, and I bet you have what you need to make them already
    sitting in your kitchen.

  <p>
    These brownies with dense, fudgy middles and crinkly tops absolutely deliver! These are perfect for boxed brownie
    lovers — the dense, moist, and fudgy texture is not all that different from what you can expect from the boxed
    mixes. It get’s better, though. These brownies are much more flavorful than anything made from a box. They taste
    amazing.
